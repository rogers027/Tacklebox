    <p>***</p>
    <p>The fish creates things, rejects them, and resurrects them back again. <br> The fish must always resurrect, as this is what the fish knows.</p>

<p>The fish knows he is a concerned fish, rotting from the head. <br>  He watches himself now, splayed open as spoon scrapes his rib bones. </p>

<p> O how it rings like tiny spiders! O to be a gutted fish! To be gutted all for you! </p>

<p>You see, the fish was once a dog rolled onto back, exposing the softest underbelly. <br> That dog was so malleable. A dog asking only for love. </p> <p>The fish was the dog whose softest underbelly had been struck with a sharp blade. </p>

<p> The fish was the dog who had touched fire. <br> The fish can no longer distinguish the difference between hot fat and cold water. </p>

<p>The fish is a yearning fish. The fish yearns for the video rental store.<br> The fish yearns again for grapes, so he partakes in the Eucharist. <br> The fish partakes in that unleavened bread that is an American boy. </p>

<p> "The fish is a fish, they all tell him." The fish knows that is not an adequate description. <br> The fish is a resurrection. The fish is concerned. The fish is a dog, struck with sharp blade. <br> The fish rings like tiny spiders. The fish partakes in that unleavened bread that is an American boy! <br> The fish is a theatre! He thinks. </p> <p> Enter and eat and drink and partake in his performance! <br> As for him, it is all theatre. It is all theatre for him.</p>
