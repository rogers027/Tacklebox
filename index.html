    <p>The fish creates things, rejects them, and resurrects them back again. The fish must always resurrect, as this is what the fish knows.</p>

<p>The fish knows he is a concerned fish, rotting from the head. He watches himself now, splayed open as a spoon scrapes his rib bones. </p>

<p> O how it rings like tiny spiders! O to be a gutted fish, to be gutted just for you! </p>

<p>The fish is a dog rolled onto his back exposing his softest underbelly. That dog was so malleable, a dog asking only for love. The fish is a dog whose softest underbelly is struck with a sharp blade. The fish is the dog who has touched fire, who can no longer distinguish the difference between hot fat and cold water. </p>

<p>The fish is a yearning fish. The fish wishes to return to the video rental store. The fish wishes again for grapes, so he partakes in the Eucharist. The fish partakes in that unleavened bread that is an American boy. </p>

<p> "The fish is a fish, they all tell him." The fish knows that is not an adequate description. The fish is a theatre. Enter! and eat! and drink! and partake in his performance! </p>

<p>As for him, it is all theatre. It is all theatre for him.</p>
